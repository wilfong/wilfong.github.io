				<p>Systems manage a wide variety of challenges.  Regulations, rate studies, customer service, training and so much more.  Through system visits and input from <a href="https://calruralwater.org/membership/applications/">CRWA membership</a>, it is clear that small systems struggle to meet all of the challenges with very limited staffing and funding options. SUSP has been created to fill that gap.</p>

                <p>SUSP is an internal CRWA program that is able to provide both short and long term solutions to Utilities. SUSP has the flexibility and staffing to provide planned services by experienced operators and managers at very competitive prices.  Staff have years of experience in the field, and hold State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) certifications in treatment and distribution, and wastewater plant operations.</p>

          <h4>Utility Rate Studies</h4>
          <p>
            SUSP will perform an analysis of, and provide recommendations on, the System’s rates.  The overall goal of a rate study is to determine appropriate rates and rate structure that will produce the desired revenue to fund a System’s budget; CIP reserves or depreciation reserves; and any other designated reserves or accounts that the staff, management and board agree upon.  SUSP will determine the rates and structure using information provided by the System liaison, and in accordance with the System’s current policies on utility rates and fees.  SUSP can attend Board Meetings as well as assist, when and if needed, with any Prop 218 meetings.

          <h4>Median Household Income (MHI) Surveys</h4>
          <p>MHI Surveys may be conducted for a drinking water/wastewater System when it is believed that the current income data provided for the System’s service area by ACS census sources are inaccurate, and that revised income data may lead to eligibility for certain funding.  A System will need to get approval from the funding agency to have an income survey conducted.  SUSP will conduct a thorough survey using guidelines provided by the requesing funding agency, and will prepare a comprehensive report of its findings for both the System and funding agency.

            SUSP fees are determined by the type of service needed; services like Contract Operations, Rate Studies or MHI’s need to be priced on an individual basis due to certain factors related to each of those services.
