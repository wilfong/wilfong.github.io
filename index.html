				<p>Systems manage a wide variety of challenges.  Regulations, rate studies, customer service, training and so much more.  Through system visits and input from <a href="https://calruralwater.org/membership/applications/">CRWA membership</a>, it is clear that small systems struggle to meet all of the challenges with very limited staffing and funding options. SUSP has been created to fill that gap.</p>

                <p>SUSP is an internal CRWA program that is able to provide both short and long term solutions to Utilities. SUSP has the flexibility and staffing to provide planned services by experienced operators and managers at very competitive prices.  Staff have years of experience in the field, and hold State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) certifications in treatment and distribution, and wastewater plant operations.</p>

                        <h4>Utility Rate Studies</h4>
                        <p>SUSP will perform an analysis of, and provide recommendations on, the System’s rates.  The overall goal of a rate study is to determine appropriate rates and rate structure that will produce the desired revenue to fund a System’s budget; CIP reserves or depreciation reserves; and any other designated reserves or accounts that the staff, management and board agree upon.  SUSP will determine the rates and structure using information provided by the System liaison, and in accordance with the System’s current policies on utility rates and fees.  SUSP can attend Board Meetings as well as assist, when and if needed, with any Prop 218 meetings.

                         <h4>Median Household Income (MHI) Surveys</h4>
                        <p>MHI Surveys may be conducted for a drinking water/wastewater System when it is believed that the current income data provided for the System’s service area by ACS census sources are inaccurate, and that revised income data may lead to eligibility for certain funding.  A System will need to get approval from the funding agency to have an income survey conducted.  SUSP will conduct a thorough survey using guidelines provided by the requesing funding agency, and will prepare a comprehensive report of its findings for both the System and funding agency.

                        <p>Provide assistance with procurement of professional services; design schematic and layouts; and early phases of design. Preliminary studies may be performed in this phase, including preliminary sizing and layout of facilities, base mapping, power supply, ROW, easement and permitting assistance, environmental assessments (e.g., CEQA environmental opinions and analysis), surveys, geotechnical studies, hydrologic/hydraulic analyses, etc.

                        <h4>Hydrogeological Analysis</h4>
                            <p><strong>Hydrogeological Studies</strong>
                            <p> Hydrogeological study aspects typically include evaluation of regional and local geology and groundwater resources, identification and evaluation of present groundwater resources, including wells and springs, review of previous groundwater studies in the area (if any), performance of a hydrogeological analysis including geologic conditions, rainfall and recharge analysis, water level trends, water balance analysis, evaluation of other groundwater extraction activities in the area and an evaluation of potential safe yield for any new groundwater extraction.</p>
                           <p><strong>Source Capacity Assessment</strong></p>
                            <p>A source capacity assessment takes into account the total water supply available from all active sources permitted for use by the water system, including any water rights or other sources which may be active but not currently used to capacity.</p>
                            <p><strong>Source Water Vulnerability Assessment and Delineation of Wellhead Protection Areas</strong></p>
                            <p>The Source Water Assessment can include both water supply well and spring sources and includes a delineation of the area around the well or the spring through which contaminants might move and reach that drinking water supply.  In addition, it includes an inventory of activities that might lead to the release of microbiological or chemical contaminants within the delineated area, a determination of the possible contaminating activities, and a summary of the vulnerability of the source to contamination.</p>
                            <p><strong>Drought Planning</strong></p>
                            <p>Drought planning and mitigation consists of an evaluation of the water system’s groundwater supply, including aquifer characteristics, water level trends, water quality trends and influence of surrounding groundwater extraction activities to determine the vulnerability of the water system’s wells and groundwater resources to declining water levels and to recommend capital improvements that would make the system’s supply less subject to these conditions</p>

                         <h4>Energy Efficiency</h4>
                        <p>Perform a system-wide energy audit to inspect and audit water system operating facilities including: Supply Wells; Intake Facilities; Treatment Facilities; Booster Pump Stations; Hydroelectric Generation Facilities; Reservoirs/Storage Tanks; Flow/Pressure Regulating Facilities; Appurtenant Facilities; Wastewater Treatment Facilities. The objective is to identify areas and components that are excessive energy users, evaluate these for energy efficiency improvements, and assist water system in implementing energy efficiency changes in their system.
